It is a simple Client-Server setup. Simply follow the steps below to spin up the application to test things out!

1. Run "npm install" to restore node_modules
3. Change directory (cd) into the Server folder
2. Run terminal command "node ." to spin up the server.

# Client
Client folder contains a simple React application. 
1. Run "npm install" to restore node_modules
